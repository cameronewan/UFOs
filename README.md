# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis:
Dana wanted us to create a dyanimc webpage for her so that she could share her UFO data with the public. She wanted to be able to filter the data based on several different parameters. giving the user of her website a very interactive experience. I used Javascript and D3 to create an HTML webpage that will work perfectly for what she needs. To all the alien doubters out there, check out this webpage and it might just change your mind. 


## Results:
Once the webpage is open users are greated with a nice header and a brief quotation and intorduction to what the page is about. Scroll down a little and you will see the search/filter options which are available. You can filter by City, State, Country, or Shape. You can either search for very spefiic evetns and fill out all the fields or you can simply search by just one field such as state, and you will see all the sightings in that state. The data is presented right next to the filter so the webpage is easy to read.

Above you can see i have searched for all the sightings in NY state, and the webpage returned all ther results regarless of the other filters because they were empty. I made the webpage user friendly by show examples searches in each filter in order to guide the User on how to use the search functions. User's should also note that the filters are case sensitive - so all text should be lowercase, with state abbreviations and no special characters.

## Summary:
One drawback is if we look at all the date that we had access to there is one field thatis not on our webpage and that is "Duration". We have this data in our "data.js" file but no field for it because the data is a little messy and it wouldn't be easy to apply a filter to it. The data is not standardized there is a lot of differernt formats in the data file. It is unfortunate that we don't have a way right now of creating that filter in a functioning way. However, this is an aspect of the webpage we could re-work or manage to incorporate the "duration" filter because I think people will find that interesting. Another aspect I would like to change is to make the table that shows the results of the filter look a little more presetable and engaging. Adding some formatting and maybe a couple more images will really take that webpage to the next level. As of right now the table just appears a little bland and unprofessional but nothing we can't fix.
