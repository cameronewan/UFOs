# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis:
Dana wanted us to create a dyanimc webpage for her so that she could share her UFO data with the public. She wanted to be able to filter the data based on several different parameters. giving the user of her website a very interactive experience. I used Javascript and D3 to create an HTML webpage that will work perfectly for what she needs. To all the alien doubters out there, check out this webpage and it might just change your mind. 


## Results:
Once the webpage is open users are greated with a nice header and a brief quotation and intorduction to what the page is about. Scroll down a little and you will see the search/filter options which are available. You can filter by City, State, Country, or Shape. You can either search for very spefiic evetns and fill out all the fields or you can simply search by just one field such as state, and you will see all the sightings in that state. The data is presented right next to the filter so the webpage is easy to read.

Above you can see i have searched for all the sightings in NY state, and the webpage returned all ther results regarless of the other filters because they were empty. I made the webpage user friendly by show examples searches in each filter in order to guide the User on how to use the search functions. User's should also note that the filters are case sensitive - so all text should be lowercase, with state abbreviations and no special characters.

Summary:

The summary addresses one drawback of this webpage (2 pt)
