# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis:
Dana wanted us to create a dyanimc webpage for her so that she could share her UFO data with the public. She wanted to be able to filter the data based on several different parameters. giving the user of her website a very interactive experience. I used Javascript and D3 to create an HTML webpage that will work perfectly for what she needs. To all the alien doubters out there, check out this webpage and it might just change your mind. 


## Results:
Once the webpage is open users are greated with a nice header and a brief quotation and intorduction to what the page is about. Scroll down a little and you will see the search/filter options which are available. You can filter by City, State, Country, or Shape. You can either search for very spefiic evetns and fill out all the fields or you can simply search by just one field such as state, and you will see all the sightings in that state. The data is presented right next to the filter so the webpage is easy to read. 

There is a description of how to perform a search, with images. (4 pt)

The summary addresses two additional recommendations for further development (4 pt)
